    "In this notebook, we explore python's SimPy package. The open-source package was developed to allow users to model and simulate real-life scenarios using a process-interaction paradigm. SimPy's syntax is very unobtrusive. For the most part, using the SimPy package is very similar to using core python syntax. What SimPy does offer is the ability to perform a few very important functions related to simulation, such as queuing and using shared resources. Due to its leveraging already-established and well-known python libraries, such as numpy and random, to support its functionality, we find that SimPy is a strong option for those already comfortable with python syntax. It is particularly strong in it's ability to run multiple processes \"simultaneously\" that would otherwise be challenging and time-intensive to implement. We find SimPy to be a worthy modern successor to its less nimble predecessors."

    "SimPy is a python package that supports the creation of process-interaction-based simulation models. The package was first developed in 2002, and is now on version 4.0.1. While primarily developed in python, ports of the package exist for the C#, Julia, and R languages. Unlike standalone software such as Arena, SimPy is used as an addition to the existing python language, meaning a user of SimPy must be relatively familiar with python. On the same note, however, a user of python may have an easier time getting accustomed to the simulation framework once educated on some of the terminology. \n",
    "\n",
    "The package relies heavily on python's generator object in order to facilitate the concept of \"waiting\". This \"waiting\" is used to allow for processes to finish and for resources to become available. This allows the package to offer functionality analogous to an asynchronous event dispatcher. In other words, multiple processes can be made to appear as running in parallel, and these processes can trigger other processes that are due next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to other simulation software like Arena, SimPy has basic objects that are used to facilitate simulations. For example, *processes* are events that may take place, such as entering a store and shopping, or repairing a car, to give a few examples. *Resources* are objects that can be relied upon in order to carry out processes, such as a spot at a register to pay, or a mechanic to repair a car. A *container* can be used to track fluctuating resources, like the amount of money in a wallet. There are many more object types, and each comes with useful methods with which to interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, the package takes advantage of being embedded in the python language. Accordingly, functionality such as random variate generation, did not need to be re-implemented for the purpose of this package. Instead, the package allows the user to simply use other modules (such as ```random```) in conjunction with this package. That allows for the user to user already-familiar syntax for common tasks like generating a random number. In a similar vein, SimPy does not appear to offer automatically generated simulation reports. Instead, the user is expected to use built in data structures such as lists and dictionaries to track the results of the simulation as they are occuring. This allows for a great amount of customization at the expense of up front costs and tediousness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of this project, we will begin by giving a high level User Guide to using SimPy. This will display the fundamental classes that make up the core functionality of the package. Then, we will build an example simulation. This will touch on some of the more advanced concepts of SimPy. Next, we will provide comments and opinions on using the package before concluding."

    "\n",
    "- ```Environment``` - the execution space for the simulation. SimPy also supports ```RealTimeEnvironment```, which uses wall-clock time, but the standard Environment is event-based, and the progression of time is determined by the beginning and ending of events. An environment can be instantiated with a start time if using 0 is not preferred. Multiple processes often belong to one environment.\n",
    "- ```yield```/*generator* - these core python concepts are used throughout SimPy simulations in order to simulate the \"waiting\" process. One must yield a ```timeout``` object/event to ensure the simulation follows the desired rules.\n",
    "- ```Environment.timeout()``` - the ```.timeout()``` method returns an event after a specified delay. This can be thought of as Arena's \"Seize-Delay-Release\" all in one. \n",
    "- ```Environment.process()``` - once an environment is created, one should ```process``` (different from the noun process) a generator, which can be returned from a custom-defined function. In our example above, the function ```runner``` yields a generator, which gets processed by the environment. In layperson's terms, processing an item adds it to the environment for future use.\n",
    "- ```Environment.run()``` - this method executes the generators in the environment. The environment runs until either the specified time is met, or there are no further events to be processed. Alternatively, one can pass another event into the ```until``` parameter, and the simulation will run until that event is processed. "

    "The above example is no doubt a relatively basic one, but one that is extensible to many of the common call center (and other complex) scenarios explored using Arena. We were able to develop a model that relies on shared resources, implicit FIFO queues, and drawing from distributions, and scale the simulation to tens of thousands of repititions easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a personal anecdote, learning how to write a simple example simulation like the initial example in our User Guide took roughly 45 minutes of reading SimPy's documentation. This should underscore the ease of learning SimPy for one already relatively well-versed in python syntax and concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "SimPy's strength lies in its flexibility. Using SimPy is very close in nature to using only out-of-the-box python data structures, with syntactically-simple added functionality and data structures to support concepts like queueing and wait times. Accordingly, where SimPy may lack certain features (such as, for example, the ability to adjust a resource's capacity after it is created), one can build supporting methods and classes to carry out additional functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "SimPy (which is open source) could benefit from either additional functionality or boilerplate code examples in the documentation related to reporting and monitoring. Currently, all activity during the simulation must be stored in global variables in order to be retrieved later, and then any calculations must also be performed manually. This can become tedious for larger examples with many more processes and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "SimPy's compatibility with already-established statistical packages is a strong feature - it allows users to benefit from any comfortability they already may have with those packages, and avoids \"reinventing the wheel\" and allows statistical software to be developed by dedicated developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to using Arena, where many new concepts and syntax had to be learned, SimPy had a smooth learning curve. Managing a growing simulation with more and more processes and resources will become as complex as the code written to describe it. This puts more control in the hands of the user, and it makes for a good user experience."
